**Narcos Dynamics: Exploring the Effect of the US War on Drugs on Mexicoâ€™s Homicide Numbers**

Drugs are crime and health issues that constitute a menace to our society. Around 244,000 Americans are sent to prison annually for drug-related crimes, and drug offenses account for 26% of all arrests in the US. In the 1980s, Mexico had one principal and transcendent drug cartel- the Guadalajara cartel. This cartel was composed of smaller regional cartels and controlled major Mexican smuggling routes of drugs into the US. Unfortunately, one of the leaders of this cartel killed a DEA agent in 1985. This brought the wrath and fury of the entire US government on cartels in Central America. The US government funded the DEA up to the tune of $1.6 Billion in 1986. And the US invaded Central America to hunt down cartel leaders. This led to the breakup of the Guadalajara cartel in 1989 as many of its leaders were killed or arrested. Resultantly, the breakup of the Guadalajara cartel unfortunately led to many turf wars over smuggling routes in Mexico.
This research will investigate one of these turf wars and determine its effect on homicides in Mexico. As noble as the war on drugs campaign has been, considering the negative impacts of drugs on society, it is noteworthy to consider the impacts of this militant approach on lives and communities. This research seeks to shed light on this and foster discussions on alternative approaches to drug offensive.
